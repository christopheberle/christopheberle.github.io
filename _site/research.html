<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Spatio-temporal couplings are couplings between a laser pulseâ€™s transverse profile and the time domain. These couplings cause a sizeable reduction in attainable peak focal intensity, yet accurately measuring them is highly non-trivial and requires reconstruction of the complete spatio-temporal electric field \(E(x, y, t)\). The origin and manifestation of spatio-temporal couplings, as well as their mathematical description up to first order will be discussed, where after an overview of principle methods of wavefront reconstruction will form the basis for a presentation of the two state-of-the-art diagnostics for complete spatio-temporal reconstruction, namely TERMITES and STRIPED FISH. Lastly, we propose a setup that combines TERMITES and STRIPED FISH into a single setup, allowing for cross-validation of both setups.</div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<div style="text-align: justify">Full characterisation of ultra-intense laser pulses not only requires their separate characterisation in space and time, but also measurement of the entire spatio-temporal field distribution \(E(x,y,t)\). While a variety of techniques has been developed for this purpose (e.g. STARFISH, TERMITES or INSIGHT), most of them rely on spatial or temporal scanning and thus require some thousand shots for a single measurement. An exception to this rule is STRIPED-FISH, which uses interferometry combined with hyperspectral imaging. We present a variation of STRIPED-FISH for implementation at the ATLAS-3000 multi-PW laser system in Garching. Providing the spatio-temporal distribution in a single shot, the setup is particularly suitable for experiments with low-repetition rate lasers aiming for highest focal intensities.</div>
